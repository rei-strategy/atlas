## Atlas Progress Log

### Session 1 - 2026-02-05

**Features Completed: #1, #2, #3 (Infrastructure)**

**What was accomplished:**
- Feature #1: Database connection established
  - Verified /api/health endpoint returns {status: "healthy", database: "connected", timestamp}
  - Server logs show "Database connection established" on startup
  - Screenshot verified in browser

- Feature #2: Database schema applied correctly
  - Verified all 16 tables exist: agencies, users, customers, clients, trips, travelers, bookings, tasks, email_templates, email_queue, documents, approval_requests, audit_logs, trip_change_records, notifications, agency_settings
  - Verified correct columns on each table match app_spec.txt
  - Verified foreign key constraints (agencies->users, clients->trips, etc.)
  - Verified 28 performance indexes present

- Feature #3: Data persists across server restart
  - Registered test user (restart_test_12345@test.com) with unique data
  - Verified user exists via /api/auth/me
  - Killed server process (kill -9)
  - Confirmed server stopped (no process on port 3001)
  - Restarted server
  - Successfully logged in with same credentials — data persisted
  - No mock data patterns found in codebase (grep verified)

**Current state:**
- Backend server running on port 3001
- Frontend dev server running on port 3000
- Auth routes wired up (/api/auth/register, /api/auth/login, /api/auth/logout, /api/auth/me)
- SQLite database at server/atlas.db with full schema
- 3/240 features passing (1.25%)

**What should be worked on next:**
- Features #4 and #5 (remaining Infrastructure features)
- Then Authentication & Multi-tenancy features
- All other route modules need to be implemented (clients, trips, tasks, bookings, etc.)
- Frontend pages need to be built

**Known state:**
- Test user exists in DB: restart_test_12345@test.com / TestPass123 (agency: RESTART_TEST_AGENCY_12345)
- There may be another user from a previous session's init (id=1)
