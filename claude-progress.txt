#### Feature #121: Notification deduplication
- System prevents duplicate notifications for the same event
- Added `event_key` column to notifications table for unique event identification
- Created unique index on (user_id, event_key) to prevent database-level duplicates
- Created notificationService.js with:
  - `createNotification()`: Creates notification with deduplication check
  - `createNotificationsForUsers()`: Creates notifications for multiple users
  - `generateEventKey()`: Generates unique event keys like "new_inquiry:trip:123"
- Updated trip creation to use deduplication service

#### Verification Steps Completed
1. Created test user: dedup_test@example.com / TestPass123 (Dedup Test Agency, ID: 45)
2. Created client and trips to generate notifications
3. Verified direct dedup test:
   - First attempt: Created notification (id: 10)
   - Second attempt (same event_key): Duplicate prevented
   - Third attempt (different user): Created notification (id: 11)
4. Database unique constraint verified: INSERT with duplicate event_key fails with UNIQUE constraint error
5. Server restart persistence test: PASSED - notifications persisted with event_keys intact
6. Mock data grep: No mock patterns in production code
7. Trip notification counts verified:
   - Trip 19: 1 notification (only admin existed)
   - Trip 20: 2 notifications (admin + planner, no duplicates)
   - Trip 21: 2 notifications (admin + planner, no duplicates)

#### Key Implementation Details
- server/src/config/initDb.js: Added event_key column to notifications table
- server/src/services/notificationService.js: New service with deduplication logic
- server/src/routes/trips.js: Updated to use notification service
- server/src/routes/notifications.js: Added eventKey to response format
- Event key format: "event_type:entity_type:entity_id:user:user_id"

#### Test Data Created
- Agency: Dedup Test Agency (ID: 45)
- Admin: dedup_test@example.com / TestPass123
- Planner: planner2_dedup@example.com / TestPass123
- Client: Test Client (ID: 75)
- Trips: DEDUP_TEST_TRIP_121, DEDUP_MULTI_USER_TRIP, FINAL_DEDUP_TEST

#### Current State

- Backend on port 3001, Frontend on port 3000
- Notification deduplication fully functional
- Zero console errors

### Session - 2026-02-06 (Feature #216)

**Feature Completed: #216 (Empty search returns all results)**

#### Feature #216: Empty search returns all results
- Verified that clearing the search box shows complete unfiltered list
- Feature steps verified:
  1. Navigate to client list - shows all 4 test clients
  2. Enter search term "Bob" - shows 1 filtered result
  3. Clear search box (empty string) - shows all 4 clients again
  4. No search parameter - shows all 4 clients

#### Verification Details
- Backend: GET /api/clients correctly handles empty search param by returning all clients
- Frontend: ClientsPage.js only adds search param if truthy (line 445)
- handleClearFilters() sets search to '' which triggers fetch without search param
- Server restart persistence verified - all data intact
- Mock data grep: No mock patterns in production code
- Client build: Compiled successfully with no errors

#### Test Data
- Agency: Feature216 Test Agency (ID: 46)
- User: feature216@test.com / TestPass123
